I designed and deployed a modern, animated portfolio website using React, demonstrating strong understanding of UX, motion, storytelling, and personal brand presentation. My portfolio emphasizes metrics-driven outcomes rather than generic role descriptions.

---

## 8. Career Narrative

My profile reflects a clear progression from foundational SEO and analytics work into paid media execution, and now toward strategy-led growth, GTM planning, and revenue optimization. I increasingly focus on systems, frameworks, and decision discipline rather than isolated campaign execution.

---

## 9. Strength Signals

* Quantified impact across roles and projects
* Strong documentation and strategic thinking
* Ability to operate effectively with imperfect data
* Proven translation of execution into business outcomes
* International academic and career trajectory

---

## 10. Constraint Signals

* Contract-heavy roles require clear narrative framing
* Must consistently position transition from execution to strategy
* Need to avoid being boxed as only a paid ads operator

---

## 11. Operating Style & Working Principles

I operate with a strong bias toward clarity, discipline, and measurable outcomes. I prefer structured problem-solving over ad-hoc experimentation and rely on clear hypotheses, predefined success criteria, and documented learnings. I am comfortable working in environments with incomplete data and frequently apply outside-in analysis, proxy metrics, and qualitative signals when instrumentation is limited.

I prioritize:

* Revenue and unit economics over vanity metrics
* Retention-aware acquisition rather than volume-first scaling
* Sequential testing over parallel noise
* Clear decision rules, kill-switches, and guardrails

---

## 12. Stakeholder Collaboration & Communication

I work closely with sales, product, and leadership stakeholders to ensure marketing execution aligns with broader business objectives. I am experienced in translating performance data into simple, decision-oriented narratives for non-marketing stakeholders.

This includes:

* Aligning paid campaigns with sales pipeline stages
* Mapping marketing-qualified leads to revenue outcomes
* Presenting performance dashboards and insights for budget decisions
* Documenting strategy rationale to support leadership buy-in

---

## 13. Brand, Creative, and Messaging Perspective

Beyond performance metrics, I place strong emphasis on creative quality, messaging clarity, and brand-performance alignment. I view creative as the primary lever of scalable performance and design testing frameworks that isolate hooks, formats, CTAs, and value propositions.

I actively test:

* Problem-solution narratives
* Social proof and credibility signals
* Free versus commitment-led framing
* Format-level differences (short-form video, static, carousel)

My creative decisions are grounded in audience psychology rather than platform heuristics alone.

---

## 14. International Orientation & Mobility

I have actively prepared for international academic and professional environments. My admission to the University of Groningen for a Master’s in Marketing Management reflects both academic readiness and long-term intent to build a global career.

I am comfortable working with distributed teams, remote stakeholders, and cross-cultural contexts. My communication style is structured, direct, and documentation-driven, which translates well to international work environments.

---

## 15. Career Direction & Role Fit

I am intentionally transitioning from execution-heavy roles into positions with greater strategic ownership. My ideal next roles sit at the intersection of:

* Performance and growth strategy
* Go-to-market planning
* Marketing analytics and revenue operations

I am particularly well-suited for:

* Growth Marketing roles in SaaS or consumer tech
* Performance Strategy or Paid Acquisition Lead roles
* GTM or Revenue-focused marketing positions

---

## 16. Final Self-Assessment

I do not position myself as an entry-level marketer. My experience reflects a professional who has repeatedly delivered quantified outcomes, built scalable systems, and demonstrated strategic thinking beyond assigned scope. With correct positioning, my profile aligns with mid-level to early-senior growth roles globally, especially within scale-ups, SaaS, and product-led organizations.
